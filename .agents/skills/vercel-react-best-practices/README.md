# React Best Practices

Vendored React/Next.js rule pack for agent consumption. This repo intentionally ships the rule content, not the upstream package's build pipeline.

## Structure

- `rules/` - Individual rule files (one per rule)
  - `_sections.md` - Section metadata (titles, impacts, descriptions)
  - `_template.md` - Template for creating new rules
  - `area-description.md` - Individual rule files
- `AGENTS.md` - compiled guidance consumed by agents in the original source package
- `README.md` - maintainer notes for this vendored copy

## Getting Started

1. Start with `SKILL.md` to understand when this rule pack should be invoked.
2. Open the relevant files in `rules/` for the specific React or Next.js concern you are touching.
3. Treat examples here as guidance to adapt, not as copy-paste truth without checking framework/runtime details.

If you need the original authoring/build workflow, fetch the upstream package rather than assuming those scripts exist in this repository.

## Creating a New Rule

1. Copy `rules/_template.md` to `rules/area-description.md`
2. Choose the appropriate area prefix:
   - `async-` for Eliminating Waterfalls (Section 1)
   - `bundle-` for Bundle Size Optimization (Section 2)
   - `server-` for Server-Side Performance (Section 3)
   - `client-` for Client-Side Data Fetching (Section 4)
   - `rerender-` for Re-render Optimization (Section 5)
   - `rendering-` for Rendering Performance (Section 6)
   - `js-` for JavaScript Performance (Section 7)
   - `advanced-` for Advanced Patterns (Section 8)
3. Fill in the frontmatter and content
4. Ensure you have clear examples with explanations
5. Keep examples accurate and self-contained for agent consumption

## Rule File Structure

Each rule file should follow this structure:

````markdown
---
title: Rule Title Here
impact: MEDIUM
impactDescription: Optional description
tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
---

## Rule Title Here

Brief explanation of the rule and why it matters.

**Incorrect (description of what's wrong):**

```typescript
// Bad code example
```

**Correct (description of what's right):**

```typescript
// Good code example
```

Optional explanatory text after examples.

````

## File Naming Convention

- Files starting with `_` are special (excluded from build)
- Rule files: `area-description.md` (e.g., `async-parallel.md`)
- Section is automatically inferred from filename prefix
- Rules are sorted alphabetically by title within each section
- IDs (e.g., 1.1, 1.2) are auto-generated during build

## Impact Levels

- `CRITICAL` - Highest priority, major performance gains
- `HIGH` - Significant performance improvements
- `MEDIUM-HIGH` - Moderate-high gains
- `MEDIUM` - Moderate performance improvements
- `LOW-MEDIUM` - Low-medium gains
- `LOW` - Incremental improvements

## Contributing

When adding or modifying rules:

1. Use the correct filename prefix for your section
2. Follow the `_template.md` structure
3. Include clear bad/good examples with explanations
4. Add appropriate tags
5. Verify any claimed framework behavior against the source docs
6. Rules are automatically sorted by title in the upstream pack - no need to manage numbers here
